# Rafa's Homelab

One repo to rull them all. It's a bit messy but does the job.

I keep doing things manual as a lab, once I decide if I'll keep them around for longer they are ported to this repo.

Credits to [mdlayher/homelab](github.com/mdlayher/homelab) for all things prometheus and apcupsd, it saved me a lot of time!
